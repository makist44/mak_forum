I want you to build a fully functional, secure forum web application.
This forum is for an online community Algerians who are of Amazigh origins and is called "Arraw Tllelli" the app must be in French and contains multiple discussion areas for:

General Discussion

Politics (this category is extremely important)

History

Off-Topic

Religion & Spirituality

Books & Literature

Technology

Memes

Music



Private Invite-Only Section (only accessible after manual approval)

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

This forum is meant to protect a vulnerable community, so security is top priority. Implement:

Password hashing with bcrypt

Email + password login system

Session-based authentication (no Firebase, no 3rd party provider auth)

Role system:

admin

moderator

member

new user (restricted)

Moderation tools for admins & mods

Anti-spam & rate limiting

Input sanitization

CSRF protection

SQL injection protection via parameterized queries

Store no unnecessary data

Allow TOR users

TECH STACK (IMPORTANT — SQL ONLY)

Use this stack:

Backend: Node.js + Express

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS (or React if needed)

Database: MySQL or MariaDB (generate a .sql file!)

ORM: Knex.js OR raw prepared statements (your choice)

Sessions: Express-session + MySQL session store

Password hashing: bcrypt

Hosting flexibility: Must run on ANY provider (local or remote)

DATABASE REQUIREMENT

Generate a database.sql file that I can download, containing:

users table

roles table

forums table

categories table

threads table

posts table

private_invites table

moderation_logs table

banned_ips table

sessions table (if using a SQL session store)

Include sample seed data (1 admin, 1 mod, and categories listed above).

INVITE-ONLY SECTION

There must be a private category called Makist that:

Does NOT appear unless the user is approved

Requires manual admin approval

Has a separate table for invite requests

Has different permissions rules

UI REQUIREMENTS

The UI should look similar to cracked.to:

Dark theme

Dense thread listing

Left sidebar with categories

Right sidebar with trending posts & forum stats

Modern, clean, sleek

Mobile responsive

Light animations ok

WHAT YOU MUST GENERATE FOR ME

Full project folder structure

All backend code (Express routes, auth, middleware, security, thread/post logic)

All frontend pages (HTML/CSS/JS or React components)

A fully generated database.sql file

A README.md with:

How to import the SQL file

How to connect environment variables

How to run the server locally

How to deploy it anywhere (Railway, VPS, cPanel, etc.)

Make sure everything is complete and production-ready.
Make sure the invite-only private section is implemented exactly as described.
Make sure NO Firebase and NO Google dependencies exist.
Everything should work with ONLY an SQL database.v
